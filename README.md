The Ultimate AI Emotion Therapist is a cutting-edge narrow AI system designed to analyze user input, detect nuanced emotions, and generate compassionate, therapist-like responses. Leveraging a hybrid approach, the system combines a massive emotion lexicon inspired by the NRC Emotion Lexicon with semantic analysis via the Universal Sentence Encoder and an optional pre-trained TensorFlow.js model. It continuously learns and refines its responses by adjusting keyword weights based on user feedback, stored persistently to adapt over time. Additionally, the system features voice integration and an animated emotion chart for an engaging, interactive user experience. This project exemplifies how rule-based techniques, machine learning, and real-time feedback can work together to create a responsive, emotionally intelligent AI.
